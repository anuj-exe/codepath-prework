## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
1. YouTube
   - Picture in picture feature
   - Extremely engaging short-form content bar with a lot of facilitating features
   - Smooth connectivity with Play store and App store facilitating fast payments and purchases
2. Discord
   - the smoothness of the app despite being loaded with features
   - ability to create bots in the app and have them do anything a human user can do
   - Live streaming
   - GIF Emojis
3. Snapchat
   - Live location sharing on the snap map, which has a very attractive UI
   - Bitmojis
   - Ability to animate your bitmojis

APP IDEA:
An app connected to GSU's Navigate application, for students to able to enter their daily life schedules and get recommendations on what classes they should register for on basis of their free time, required courses and some AI training of what kind of schedules do students prefer. I would use OpenAI API on my backend server with SQL to process this feature and iOS dev skills for the UX and the application part.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I was little stuck while adding the changeBackgroundColor function.
